	Today, we are a lot of things in the class, and teacher give us 
the first workshop to do. The program is not difficlut actually but I 
still made many errors. For become a good programmer, people need to be 
paitence. Finally, if something I do not know or comfusing, then ask 
classmate and teacher to solve that.
