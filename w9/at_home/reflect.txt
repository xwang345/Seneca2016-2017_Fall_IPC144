1)What is the difference between opening a file in ¡°a¡± mode versus ¡°a+¡± mode?
	For "a" mode:
		Wirte to the end of the file.
	For "a+" mode:
		Opens the file for writing to the end of the file and possibly reading.

2)In this workshop, a file was used to save a table. What was the first record in this table? What was the third field?
	1. 10 50.34 61.00 30.00 50.50
	2. 55 10.00 20.00 30.00 40.50

3)Why do we need to call the function srand()? What happens if we don't call it before using rand()? 
	1. We using "srand()" function provides a unique seed for each run and hence different pseudo-random numbers.
	2. Returns a pseudo-random number in the range of 0 to RAND_MAX.
