3. What are parallel array and what are they used for?
	Parallel Arrary is some separate array that programmer declare the same number of elements, contains for data or some data contain relate to each other. For using a parallel array; For example, in the workshop4 program, need put student infromations. The frist data in the first array that will related in second array, and first element of index number as same as second element of index number, then the parallel array will keep the input until to use them.
