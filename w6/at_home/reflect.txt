1)What is a function and briefly discuss the need for functions in any language?

	First of all, function is group of statements which work together for the task. Programmer can divide up their jobs into separate funtions; usually, a large code cannot write by only one programmer, so it have a lot of benefits for using function. 

2)Comment on the modularity and reusability of balanceUp and balanceDown functions. (Hint: Each function was called twice for different purposes each time)

	There are a lots benefits for using function. The main benefits, such as, less code has to be written in program code, a single procedure can be developed for reuse, eliminating the need to retype the code many times and same code can be used in many applications.

3)How do you send and receive data back to and from functions.

	Usually, function is declare above the main founction. If you want use that function into the main fuction, you can call the function in the main fuction.
