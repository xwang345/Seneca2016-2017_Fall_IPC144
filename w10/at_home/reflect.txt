1)Why do you need to be careful with the terminating null character in strings? 
	Because if you do not careful with the last null character, after print string the null character will display instead of the last string's character.  
2)What can happen if the terminating null is not inserted or if it is overwritten accidentally?
	After printout, the program will ignore the last character letter.
