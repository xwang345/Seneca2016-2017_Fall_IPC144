	In week 2 lab works, I was learn how to use the 'scanf' command to get the input numbers,and using 'printf'print the result on the screen. However, there a some eorrors I made during doing at Lab and at home works such as missing the comma after finish each command line, some I put capital case but I am actually use lower case to get the value and add some extra number or words. In conclusion, to aviod some eorros that I made, I should wirte the code more clearly and think logically.
